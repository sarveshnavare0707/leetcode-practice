Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

    "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
    "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
    "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

with nt as ( 
    select case 
        when income<20000 then "Low Salary"
        when income between 20000 and 50000 then "Average Salary"
        else "High Salary" end as category, 1 as ct
    from accounts
    union all
    select 'Low Salary', 0 
    union all
    select 'Average Salary', 0
    union all
    select 'High Salary', 0
    )
select category, sum(ct) as accounts_count from nt group by category


-- (
--     select "Low Salary" as category ,
--     (select count(*) from Accounts where income<20000) as accounts_count
-- )
-- union all
