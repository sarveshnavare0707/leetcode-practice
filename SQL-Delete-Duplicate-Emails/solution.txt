Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

 

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

-- DELETE p1 FROM Person p1
-- JOIN Person p2 
-- ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;

WITH DuplicatesToDelete AS (
    SELECT id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            id,
            email,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS row_num
        FROM Person
    ) ranked
    WHERE row_num > 1
)

DELETE FROM Person 
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM DuplicatesToDelete);
