Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in descending order based on the page IDs.

WITH JOINS

SELECT pages.PAGE_ID FROM pages
LEFT JOIN 
(SELECT PAGE_ID FROM page_likes) AS T
ON pages.PAGE_ID = T.PAGE_ID
WHERE T.PAGE_ID IS NULL
ORDER BY pages.PAGE_ID DESC;

WITH SUBQUERY

SELECT pages.PAGE_ID FROM pages
where pages.PAGE_ID NOT IN
(SELECT page_likes.PAGE_ID from page_likes)
ORDER BY pages.PAGE_ID DESC;

WITH EXCEPT

SELECT pages.PAGE_ID FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_likes.PAGE_ID FROM page_likes
ORDER BY PAGE_ID DESC;
