Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each user’s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

Using Extract

SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(DAY FROM (MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date))) AS "days_between"
FROM posts
WHERE post_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING count(post_id) > 1;

Using CTE

with temp AS
(
SELECT user_id, min(date(post_date)) as min_date, max(date(post_date)) as max_date
FROM posts
where EXTRACT(year from post_date) = 2021
group by user_id
)

select user_id, (max_date - min_date) as days_between
from temp
where max_date <> min_date


Using Date_Part

SELECT
     user_id,
     DATE_PART ('day', MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
    FROM posts
    WHERE post_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31'
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING COUNT(user_id) >=2 AND DATE_PART ('day', MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date))>0
    ORDER BY user_id DESC
