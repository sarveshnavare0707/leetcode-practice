Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

    Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
    To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

Using CASE

SELECT app_id, Round(100.0*T.click_count/T.impression_count,2) as CTR from
(
SELECT 
  app_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as click_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as impression_count
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT(year from timestamp)='2022'
GROUP BY app_id
) as T

Using FILTER

SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'click') /
    SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'impression'), 2) AS ctr_app
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
