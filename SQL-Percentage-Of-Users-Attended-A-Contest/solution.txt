Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

select T.contest_id, 
    round(count(T.user_id)*100/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users),2) AS percentage from users
inner join
(select * from register) as T
on users.user_id=T.user_id
group by T.contest_id
order by percentage desc, contest_id
