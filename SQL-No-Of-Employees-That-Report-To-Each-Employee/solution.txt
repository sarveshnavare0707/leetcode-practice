Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |

employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 

 

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

# Write your MySQL query statement below


with manager as(
select * from employees
left join
(select employee_id as manager_id, name as manager_name from employees) as T
on employees.reports_to = T.manager_id
where T.manager_id is not null)
select manager_id as employee_id, manager_name as name, count(employee_id) as reports_count, round(avg(age),0) as average_age from manager
group by manager_id
order by employee_id;
