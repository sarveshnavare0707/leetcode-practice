Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

Hint:

    An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

WITH july AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM event_date) as month,
           user_id,
           event_id
    FROM user_actions
    WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM event_date) = 07),
june AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM event_date) as month,
           user_id,
           event_id
    FROM user_actions
    WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM event_date) = 06)
SELECT month, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS monthly_active_users
FROM july
WHERE user_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM june)
GROUP BY month;
